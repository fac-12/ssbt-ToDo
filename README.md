## WHAT DID WE DO? :confused:

SSBT built a to-do list app with a focus on **TDD testing** with the following user stories in mind:

### As a disorganised person I want to:

* enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
* view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
* mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
* the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb


## Potential stretch goals :100:


### As a disorganised person I want to:

edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing

## HOW DID WE DO IT?

With a focus on TDD.

Meaning that we wrote failing tests first and then wrote functions around those.

**1. Part one: create some pure functions**
**2. Part 2: use the TDD functions to build the app!**

## WHY DID WE DO IT?

To learn about the importance of writing tests for the code we create.
